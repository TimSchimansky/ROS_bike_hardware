# PiBike
## A ROS based Sensor Plattform

The PiBike project was created by Tim P. J. Schimansky over the course of his master thesis in 2022.

### Hardware

The hardware consists of the following parts:

- Logging-Unit
	- Power supply and distribution
	- Raspberry Pi
	- User Interface
	- Real-Time-Clock
- Side-Sensor-Unit
	- Qumox SJCAM5000
	- Ultrasonic distance sensor 
- Smartphone
	- Hardware requirements
	- Neccessary App

#### Logging-Unit

The Logging-Unit combines all the core components of the system into a single, easy to install platform.

The Logging-Unit is self sufficient as it can work without any othe components. Depending on the Setup, it wont be very useful.

##### Power supply and distribution

The Unit is currently powered by any 12V Battery, that can deliver at least
